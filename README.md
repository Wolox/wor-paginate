## Description

Wor::Paginate is a gem for Rails that simplifies pagination, particularly for controller methods, while standardizing JSON output for APIs. It's meant to work both as a standalone pagination gem and as an extra layer over [Kaminari](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari) and [will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate).

## Installation
Add the following line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wor-paginate'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install wor-paginate
```

Then you can run `rails generate wor:paginate:install` to create the initializer for configuration details, including default formatter class, page and limit params and default page number.

## Usage
### Basic usage
The basic use case is to paginate using default values. This is achieved by including the module in a controller and calling render_paginate in the method that needs pagination.
```ruby
  class DummyModelsController < ApplicationController
    include Wor::Paginate

    def index
      render_paginated DummyModel
    end
  end
```
The first parameter to render_paginated can be multiple things:
* ActiveRecord/ActiveRecord::Relation
* Enumerables (for example, arrays and ranges)
* Pre-paginated Kaminari or will_paginate relations (original pagination will be ignored)

The response to the index will then be:
```json
{
  "page": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "1c",
      "something": 27
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "i",
      "something": 68
    },
    // ...
    {
      "id": 25,
      "name": "2m",
      "something": 32
    }
  ],
  "count": 25,
  "total_pages": 2,
  "total_count": 28,
  "current_page": 1,
  "previous_page": null,
  "next_page": 2
}
```

Page number is passed through the `page` option of the `render_paginated` method. If none is supplied, `params[:page]` will be used, (or the default parameter configured in the initializer).
By default, if the page parameter is not present we will use 1 as the page (or the default `page` parameter configured in the initializer).
The amount of items is passed through the `limit` option of the `render_paginated` method. If none is supplied, `params[:limit]` will be used (or the default parameter configured in the initializer). Default is 25.
The default serializer and formatter will be used.

### Customizing output
#### Custom serializers
A custom serializer for each object can be passed using the `each_serializer` option:
```ruby
render_paginated DummyModel, each_serializer: CustomDummyModelSerializer
```
where the serializer is just an [`ActiveModel::Serializer`](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers).

#### Custom options
##### max_limit
The max amount of items is passed through the `max_limit` option, You can set the value in the initializer or in the `render_paginated` method, (If none is supplied, take the default value configured in the initializer). Default is 50.

```ruby
  render_paginated DummyModel, max_limit: 100
```

##### current_user
Using custom options in serializer, example method `current_user`

```ruby
render_paginated DummyModel, each_serializer: CustomDummyModelSerializer, current_user: current_user
```

In serializer

```ruby
class CustomSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  def method
    @instance_options[:current_user]
  end
end
```

#### Custom formatters
A formatter is an object that defines the output of the render_paginated method. In case the application needs a different format for a request, it can be passed to the `render_paginated` method using the `formatter` option:
```ruby
render_paginated DummyModel, formatter: CustomFormatter
```
or it can also be set as a default in the initializer.

A new formatter can be created inheriting from the default one. The `format` method should be redefined returning something that can be converted to json.

```ruby
class CustomFormatter < Wor::Paginate::Formatter
  def format
    { page: serialized_content, current: current_page }
  end
end
```

Available helper methods are:
* `current_page`: integer with the current page
* `count`: number of items in the page (post-pagination)
* `total_count`: number of total items (pre-pagination)
* `total_pages`: number of pages given the current limit (post-pagination)
* `paginated_content`: its class depends on the original content passed to render_paginated, it's the paginated but not yet serialized content.
* `serialized_content`: array with all the items after going through the serializer (either the default or a supplied one)

### Working with Kaminari or will_paginate
If either Kaminari or will_paginate are required in the project, Wor::Paginate will use them for pagination with no code or configuration change.

### Test helpers
You can use the `be_paginated` matcher to test your endpoints. It also accepts the `with` chain method to receive a formatter.

You only need to add this in your rails_helper.rb

```ruby
# spec/rails_helper.rb
require 'wor/paginate/rspec'
```

And in your spec do
```ruby
# spec/controllers/your_controller.rb
describe YourController do
  let(:response_body) do
    ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(response.body) if response.present? && response.body.present?
  end

  describe '#index' do
    subject(:http_request) { get :index }

    it { expect(response_body).to be_paginated }
  end

  describe '#index_with_custom_formatter' do
    subject(:http_request) { get :index_custom_formatter }

    it 'checks that the response keys matches with the custom formatter' do
      expect(response_body).to be_paginated.with(CustomFormatter)
    end
  end
end
```
